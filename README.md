# World-Statistical-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
## About the project
Data visualization & Analysis on world population throughout history, birth rate and death rate of each country, and diseases causing the most deaths.

#### Choropleth - 
Enables comparisons to be made between country or regional population throughout history. Darker shades might indicates a higher population density or total population, while lighter shades or no color might indicate lower population. This type of map provides a visual representation of population distribution across the world.

#### Birth Rate VS Death Rate - 
Demonstrates the birth and death rate of each continent as represented a different colour. Range slider allows for visualization between a particular time period and determines population trends for a particular region.
Plotted again y=x (no net gain/loss of population) to determine whether population is falling or rising.

#### Death Causes - 
Showcases the most fatal diseases throughout a particular year, a larger sector on the pie chart represent a greater portion of death attributed to a specific disease.
